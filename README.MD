# Tic-tac-toe

Idea :
1. Implement the minimax algorithm to play tic-tac-toe
2. Create a dataset, consisting of board configurations $c_i$ (9 input-parameters) and optimal moves $m_i$ with minimax 
3. Train a neural network with that dataset
4. Let the minimax algorithm play against the neural network
